IntelliDB üó£Ô∏è - A Natural Language Database Interface
IntelliDB is a modern web application that bridges the gap between complex database queries and natural human language. It allows users to securely connect to their MySQL databases and ask questions in plain English, receiving instant SQL results and data tables. This tool is designed to empower team members of all technical levels to interact with data intuitively, without needing to write a single line of SQL.

‚ú® Features
Secure User Authentication: Full login and registration system with persistent user sessions, powered by Spring Security.

Encrypted Connection Management: Users can save, edit, and delete multiple database connections. Credentials are fully encrypted at rest using AES.

Natural Language to SQL: At its core, IntelliDB uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to translate questions like "show me the top 5 highest paid employees" into executable SQL queries.

Schema-Aware Intelligence: The AI is provided with the full table schema (CREATE TABLE statements) to generate accurate, context-aware queries.

Interactive Dashboard: A sleek, dark-themed dashboard to manage connections and view database schemas.

Dynamic Query Interface: Features a schema viewer, a query history panel, and an interactive results table.

Data Exploration Tools:

Table Previews: Click any table to see its structure and a preview of the first 10 rows.

Sortable Results: Click on any column header in the results table to sort the data.

Export to CSV: Download any query result set as a CSV file with a single click.

Built-in Security: Includes a confirmation step for potentially destructive queries (like UPDATE or DELETE) to prevent accidental data modification.
